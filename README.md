Pulse - Heartbeat API Example Plugin
=====

# What is Pulse?

Pulse by Jeffikus is an example plugin for the Heartbeat API! It is a starting point for building your heartbeat functionality into your WordPress powered application or plugin.

# Why on Github and not WordPress.org

WordPress.org is where your finished plugins should go (assuming they are free) while this plugin doesn't actually perform any function or add value on its own - you need to make the magic happen :-)

# What can I do with Heartbeat?

There are loads of possibilities; Chat applications, Notifications on the frontend, manipulation of the Dom based on events happening in the CMS, all types of (almost) real-time functionality.
